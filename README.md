# 100DaysOfCoding (Not confined to 100)
This is the repo for tracking my 100 days of coding challenge

# Here in this repo, I want to explore new technologies/engineering patterns like Design Patterns, Docker, Elastic Search and SQL, Kubernates, Microservices, Domain Design Pattern, Streaming technologies like Apache Kafka, Kinesis Streams, and last but not least Python.

So I know covering these many technologies in 100 days might be an over target. But.............

# Dream enormously big.
"Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you’ll land among the stars." –Les Brown

Nothing has benefited my life more than shooting for the moon and dreaming enormously big dreams. When you dream big and shoot for the moon, you are forcing yourself to get out of your comfort zone.

And more over I am comfortable with many of these technologies mentioned here. But wanted to go in depth and at the same time brush up my basics.
I am also thinking of implementing a similar kind of algorithms (might not be that big) but to get some idea on how they work.
For example Elastic search internally uses Lucene and backbone of Lucene are Terms, Term Frequencies. Let's say, I have a string like "Pavan is good and he is passionate about technology".
So Lucene will internally break these things into terms and also maintain them as an index and points to all docs a keyword is present in it.
So I'll try to implement similar kind of technology/algorithms when learning these things. So this way I can cover some areas of algorithms and basics.

For example lets say I am breaking 1000s of documents(Text) into terms and the real challenge will be how efficiently I can search them and retrieve corresponding documents. Oh that is not as simple as I think. It involves lots of alogrithms right? So I can tackle them that would be a perfect thing. So these 100 days I wanted to do something like that.

Also many concepts like Multi threading needs to be covered. For example If we take the case of Kafka, How does this store data internally and how subscribers are actually getting data. Whats the science behind this? So I'll try to implement such algorithms.

# Is 100 days going to be sufficient?
Obviously Nooooooooooooooooooooooooo. But this challenge is to build strong learning habits and motivate myself to tackle new challenges and understanding internals. 100 is just a number but once I am able to make it as a habbit. Then days doesnt count :)

# So my take away from this challenge is to learn new tech stack and along with that understanding its internals.

Thanks,
Pavan
